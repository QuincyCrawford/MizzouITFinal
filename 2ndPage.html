        <h1>SO! you wanna know about my family and home huh?</h1>

        <h3> well why dont we start with my home town: </h3>

I was born and raised in a "city" called Clinton Missouri. You maybe wondering why I Put city in Quotation marks. Well that would be because for a city Clinton is pretty small only around 9000 people, and well frankly outside of hunting, fishing, andmajor events in my town such as holidays or old glory days -which is our 4th of july festival- there really is not anything to do and nothing spectacular to draw anyones eye. its just a run of the mill quiet little town that we call a city. if by some weird reason you want to learn more about my humble home...
