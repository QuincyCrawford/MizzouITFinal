        I can without a doubt say that the bonds that I have already built here in a short time are some of the most real ones I have ever had.

        <p>
            Sadly I couldn't be like a certain individual. Who did everyone when they were in my shoes. but rest assured I am getting there
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I look forward to getting to spend more time with you all and know that I would do anything for every individual here
