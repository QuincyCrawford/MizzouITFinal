        <h1>My future huh? Well good question.</h1>

<p>
    well why dont I just give you a couple of short paragraphs on what I plan to do. First I hope to graduate from Mizzou with a degree in IT and plans to work in systems administration while being as well rounded of a worker as I can be. I feel like I could thrive in a production enviornment based on my prior work.

I hope to live in Minnesota long term but I would like to travel to Japan and see of course the big cities but also the vibrant countryside and massive festivals such as the sapporo snow festival. I also would like to see all the national parks like my Uncle who is also my idol in life did before his traumatic brain injury. I would in general love to see as much of the world as I can but those are the big ones
